**Decision Tree Implementation on Iris Dataset
This project implements a Decision Tree algorithm to classify Iris flowers based on their features. The Iris dataset, a classic dataset in machine learning, is used to train and evaluate the model.

Project Overview
Dataset: The Iris dataset contains measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for 150 Iris flowers, belonging to three different species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.

Algorithm: The Decision Tree algorithm is a supervised learning algorithm that partitions the feature space into a set of rectangles, and then fits a simple constant model (usually the class label) in each one.  This implementation uses the scikit-learn library.

Goal: The goal of this project is to build a Decision Tree model that can accurately predict the species of an Iris flower given its sepal and petal measurements.

Key Features
Decision Tree classification using scikit-learn.

Model training on the Iris dataset.

Clear and concise code.

Comments explaining the code.

How to Use
Clone the repository.

Ensure you have Python and the required libraries (scikit-learn) installed.

Run the main script to train and evaluate the Decision Tree model.

Results
The project demonstrates how a Decision Tree can be used for multi-class classification. The model's performance is evaluated, showing its ability to accurately classify Iris flowers.

Further Improvements
Experiment with different Decision Tree hyperparameters (e.g., max_depth, min_samples_split) to optimize performance.

Visualize the Decision Tree to better understand the decision-making process.

Explore other classification algorithms and compare their performance with the Decision Tree.**
